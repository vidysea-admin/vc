 *
 * T-014 / ISS-t-011-c3-rev-3: this file is nonetheless where releaseExpiredErasureFences
 * (packages/db src/erasure.ts) finally gets a real caller — it is the one place in this scaffold
 * that owns a live Mongo client for the eventual API process. `startApi` connects only through
 * connectFromEnv (this file never reaches the driver's own database-selection method directly —
 * packages/db/tests/db-scope.test.ts's B12 scanner would catch that) and starts the periodic fence
 * sweep ONLY when actually invoked, never on import (contract B8: importing this module performs
 * no I/O and starts no timer).

 * T-015 / ISS-t-014-rev-2: startErasureFenceSweep's own `onError` default is a no-op BY DESIGN
 * (packages/db does not own a logger or a process's stdout/stderr). `startApi` is the process that
 * DOES, so a caller who does not inject their own `onError` still gets visibility instead of a
 * fence-release failure vanishing silently forever: one structured JSON line per failing tick,
 * naming the failure. A real deployment is expected to inject its own `onError` wired to its actual
 * logging/alerting pipeline (Langfuse/observability, structured log shipper, etc.) — this default
 * is the floor, not the intended production behaviour.
 *
 * ISS-t-015-c0-1: logs `errorLabel(err)` (name + code only, the same redaction erasure.ts's own
 * receipt lines use), never `err.message`. A realistic Mongo-shaped error (e.g. an E11000
 * duplicate-key line, which real servers embed document field values into) is not exploitable
 * TODAY through this path specifically (erasureFenceKey is a SHA-256 hash, not a raw studentId; no
 * $jsonSchema validators are configured), but the no-PII guarantee on this log line should not
 * depend on that staying true.

 * Connects to `virtual_counsellor` (B12) and starts the erasure-fence sweep (D-016,
 * ISS-t-011-c3-rev-3). `env` defaults to `process.env`; a test passes a fixture instead so nothing
 * here ever reads the real environment. `stop()` clears the sweep's interval and closes the client
 * — call it on shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT) once this scaffold grows an actual server loop.
 *
 * T-015 / ISS-t-014-rev-3: everything after `client.connect()` runs inside a try/catch. A connected
 * client is a resource this function owns until it hands back `stop()` — if starting the sweep
 * fails (e.g. startErasureFenceSweep's own intervalMs validation), the caller never receives a
 * `stop()` to close it with, so this function itself closes the client before rethrowing, instead
 * of leaking a live connection.
 *
 * ISS-t-015-c0-2: closing the client is itself fallible. Before, `await client.close(); throw err;`
 * silently discarded the ROOT cause (e.g. startErasureFenceSweep's RangeError) whenever close()
 * itself threw, and left it unclear whether the client was actually released. Now a close() failure
 * is caught and reported as an AggregateError carrying BOTH the original error (first) and the
 * close failure (second), so a caller can always see the real root cause, and never mistakes a
 * close-time symptom for it.
